*Changing the Representation of Mental Disorders in Video Games*

---

## **Overview**

*Tales of Elysia* is an indie action-adventure game that aims to redefine how mental disorders—particularly anxiety and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)—are portrayed in video games. Set in a medieval fantasy world, players follow Elysia, a protagonist who battles both external foes and her internal struggles with mental health.

The game provides a nuanced, empathetic depiction of these disorders while offering a message of hope, recovery, and personal growth. It sheds light on how anxiety and ADHD affect daily life, decision-making, and combat, giving players a unique experience where mental health is a central gameplay mechanic.
